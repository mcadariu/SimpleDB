# SimpleDB
This repo contains the implementation of a simple database with features like storage, transactions, indexes and SQL query processing. 
It is the result of following along the book [Database design and implementation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Database-Design-Implementation-Data-Centric-Applications/dp/3030338355/) by E. Sciore and adapting the code to use modern Java constructs like the MemorySegment API.
